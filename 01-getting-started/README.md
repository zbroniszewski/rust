## Installation

`rustup` is a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.  
Install it with: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`  
This downloads and executes an interactive shell script that will install:
- The Rust compiler (rustc)
- rustup metadata and toolchains
- The Rust package manager (Cargo)

Note: While `rust` and `rustup` are available via brew formula, I've chosen to install via the official shell script.  
`Rust` and `rustup` should not be installed independently, and `rustup` is a dedicated tool for managing `Rust` versions.  
Both installations (`rustup` via brew, or `rustup` via the shell script) can still be automated via something like `ansible`.

### Verifying

- rustup: `rustup --version`  
- Rust compiler: `rustc --version`
- Cargo: `cargo --version`

### Updating

Updating is easy: `rustup update`

### Uninstalling

`rustup self uninstall` will uninstall both:
- rustup
- Rust (rustc)

## Offline Documentation

Offline documentation is provided by rustup:  
- `rustup doc` - opens a browser window to the index of the official Rust documentation.
- `rustup doc --help` - outputs supported CLI flags for offline documentation, ex:  
- `rustup doc --book` - opens a browser window to *"The Rust Programming Language book"* (The book I'm reading now and referencing while taking notes)

> Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and youâ€™re not sure what it does or how to use it, use the application programming interface (API) documentation to find out:
`rustup doc --std`
