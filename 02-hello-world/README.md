## The Program

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### How to Compile

`rustc main.rs` (`compile.sh` is included)  
Will save a `main` executable within current working directory.

### How to Run

The executable is available to run directly: `./main`  
Expected output:
```bash
Hello, world!
```


## Notes

There are a lot of interesting findings from this simple program.

1. The `println!` function is actually a macro, which is part of Rust's *"Zero Cost Abstractions."*  
   In this case, `println!` is expanded into further code at compile time. This expansion does not happen at runtime.
2. The size of the hello world executable is almost half a MiB:  
   ```bash
   du -bh ./main
   467K    ./main
   ```
   I've previously read complaints about Rust's executable sizes for simple programs, and I also recall strategies to improve this.
3. While Rust's style is to indent with 4 spaces, the indent length or character (space vs. tab) appears to have no effect on the compiler.
4. `rustc` does not appear to compile to universal binaries (at least by default) on MacOS:
   ```bash
   file main
   main: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
   ```
   This should mean that I *cannot* take my compiled executable on an Intel Macbook and run it on an M1 Macbook. (I'd have to recompile on the M1 Macbook first)  
   Compare this to something like the `echo` command/executable:
   ```bash
   file /bin/echo
   /bin/echo: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64e:Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e]
   /bin/echo (for architecture x86_64):    Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
   /bin/echo (for architecture arm64e):    Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e
   ```
   As far as I know, this means I should be able to copy my `/bin/echo` to an M1 Macbook (arm64) and expect it to work?

> Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.

^ I believe I've disproved this in some cases (sort of, when using `rustc` with no options) - I'm probably about to learn how the Rust compiler can compile for multiple targets:

> Just compiling with rustc is fine for simple programs, but as your project grows, youâ€™ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your code...
  The Cargo tool... will help you write real-world Rust programs.
